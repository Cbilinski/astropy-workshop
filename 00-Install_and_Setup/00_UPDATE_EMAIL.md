Dear Astropy Workshop Participants,

The workshop begins at 9:00am on January 8th! The room is 401 at the Seattle Convention Center.

If you have not yet done so, please follow the setup instructions at

https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop/blob/main/00-Install_and_Setup

If you are having problems, please arrive early at 8:30am so we can help you before the presentations
start at 9:00am.

__Updating workshop materials__

Our facilitators are polishing up workshop materials. To update the workshop
notebooks, please follow these instructions:

https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshop/blob/main/00-Install_and_Setup/UPDATING.md

It may be necessary to update just before the workshop begins.
We expect those changes to be small and to not take long.
