Dear Astropy Workshop Participant,

Thank you for registering for the workshop Using Python and Astropy for Astronomical Data Analysis,
January 8, 2023, at the 241st AAS meeting in Seattle.
The team of instructors is looking forward to seeing you at the workshop!

We are not covering the basics of Python in the workshop.
We list some introductory resources below, and we are sending these to you now
if you feel you need to work through one or two of them before the workshop.

You can install Anaconda (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) for working through
the examples above, or the smaller Mambaforge (https://mamba.readthedocs.io)
if you know what you are doing.

The final installation instructions for the workshop will be sent around the 20th of December.
