## Description
This workshop covers the use of Python tools for astronomical data analysis and visualization, with the focus primarily
on UV, Optical, and IR data. Data analysis tools for JWST are being written in Python and distributed as part of Astropy,
a community developed Python library for astronomy,  and its affiliated packages.

The workshop goals introduce you to the variety of tools which are already available inside the Astropy library as
well as provide ample hands-on time during which you’ll be able to explore the science analysis capabilities which the
greater Python environment and community provide.

We plan on accomplishing this with brief overview talks on the main tools followed by extended instructor guided tutorials
where you’ll be able to try them out for yourself and ask questions in the company of expert users and developers.

Some basic Python experience is highly recommended to be able to effectively participate in the exercises,
but those without Python experience will still get much useful information about the capabilities for data analysis in
Python and perhaps pick up some pointers on where they can get started learning more scientific Python and integrating
it into their work flow.

If you would like to get a head start with the tools we will be concentrating on you can check out their documentation on readthedocs:

* [Physical Units and Quantities](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html)
* [Constants](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/constants/index.html)
* [Coordinate utilities](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/coordinates/index.html)
* [Basics on accessing data files, both FITS and ASCII tables](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/unified.html)
* [Modeling and Fitting](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/modeling/index.html)
* [Astropy WCS](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/wcs/index.html)
* [photutils](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/)
* [specutils](https://specutils.readthedocs.io/)
* [Contributing to Astropy](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/workflow/development_workflow.html)
* [Affiliated Packages](https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/)

* Other tools we can answer questions about but probably won't discuss explicitly:
  * [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
  * [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
  * [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
  * [Git and Github](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
